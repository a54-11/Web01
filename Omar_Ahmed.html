    <h1> Omar Ahmed </h1>
    <h2> Description of Omar </h2>
    <p> Omar Ahmed is 18 years old. He was born on November 22 2004. He is Ayesha's older brother.
        He is a very big monkey and very delusional. He thinks he's the main character when in fact he isn't 
        even a side character but an extra in the background.
